# PTM-in-microbiome
Characterization of Posttranslational Modifications in the Gut Microbiome of Colon Cancer Patients

In this project we studied phosphorylation post-translational modification (PTM) in the human gut microbiome of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients in early and advanced stages, using state-of-the-art proteomics tools. First, we searched for publicly available datasets. After gathering data, we used existing tools to profile the metaproteomes and inferred proteins that have a phosphorylation event. Next, we analyzed the data and looked for specific differences in the presence or abundance of phosphorylated proteins between CRC patients in early vs. advanced stages.
